# nodeapi-rocketseat
A small API developed with Node.js, Express and MongoDB

This is my first project using Node.js. To do this project I saw a YouTube playlist from Rocketseat channel (by Diego Fernandes).

Its a simple API where I could to learn somethings about Express, Mongoose, BCryptJS, Crypto, JsonWebToken (JWT) and NodeMailer. I learned too about controllers, database models, routes (in Express router) and middlewares.
